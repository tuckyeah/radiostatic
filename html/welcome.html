                <p>The dim nicotine haze gives all the lights a diffused, brightly colored halo. Through the smoke-filled air, the Bar is much larger than it appeared from the outside, though it's too dark to really tell. <em>Supertramp</em> plays softly from a glowing jukebox in a rear corner that looks vertiginously far away.</p>

                <p>It's easy to miss him at first, the Bartender standing there with his back to the door.</p>

                <br />
                <br />
                <p>The reflection of his hands in the mirror show they match the rest of him: creased, well-worn. He's washing a tall beer glass and then dries it with an equally threadbare towel, before placing the glass among a stack of others just like it, a crystal castle. He never looks up from his work, but he can sense a new presence in his space, a new planet in his orbit.</p>
