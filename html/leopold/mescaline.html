                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Dosage: One foot (12") of <em>T. Pacanoi</em> cactus, prepared and reduced to liquid (approx. 1 cup)</em>
                    </p>

                    <p>Had high hopes about this particular experience, as our Previous Experience was quite Illuminating. Though I traveled alone this time, I felt confident that this would bring me closer to you, My Dear, as I have missed you so acutely I do not know how much longer I can go on.</p>
                    <p>After I ingested the tea, I set out into the desert towards the satellites and thought of you, with the hope that such thoughts may influence my forthcoming voyage.</p>
                    <p>Soon, the sand beneath my feet started to crumble away, collapsing into the depths of the earth and swallowing me with it. As I tumbled down into the unknown, I was struck by the sudden image that I was just another grain of sand in a giant hourglass, marking another passing moment.</p>
                    <p>I landed in a cavern of sorts, though it was pitch black and difficult to see much of anything. The darkness was so complete it felt alive. I felt the weight of the earth all around me, above me, below me, consuming me and collecting me. I could hear your heart and mine thumping, the rush of blood in our ears like waves crashing on a beach.</p>

                        I turned my face upwards, to where I had fallen from, but to my surprise I saw a thousand thousand holes across the sky, just like the one I had fallen from. I saw constellations, the lines of connection between us and the vast empty spaces that divide us. They were not holes but <em>stars,</em> and I was moving among them: another infinitesimal dot in the heavens, part of everything and yet miles apart and drifting alone through space and time. </p>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <p>As I listened, I thought of how we used to tell him, our Jeremiah, Our Sweet Child, that stars were nothing but holes to heaven. </p>

                <p style="margin-top: 30%">The cave rustled with the susurrus of voices. It sounded like hundreds of them, just too quiet or distant to decipher but still flowing with the same beautiful cadence of human speech. I heard snippets of music too, thunderous applause, the canned roar of a laugh track. Or at least I thought I could hear these things - it was like making shapes from static, seeing faces in the clouds.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center;">From the hush of voices, one grew louder, distinct, its edges clearly defined amongst the roar of the masses.</p>
                <br />
                <p style="text-align: center;">I recognized it at once as yours, as our Sweet Jeremiah's.</p>
