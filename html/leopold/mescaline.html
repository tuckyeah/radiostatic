                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Dosage: One foot (12") of <em>T. Pacanoi</em> cactus, prepared and reduced to liquid (approx. 1 cup)</em>

                    <p>Had high hopes about this particular expereince, as our Previous Experience was quite Illuminating. Though I traveled alone this time, I felt confident that this would bring me closer to you, My Dear, as I have missed you so acutely I do not know how much longer I can go on.</p>
                    <p>After I ingested the tea, I set out into the desert towards the satellites and thought of you, with the hope that such thoughts may influence my forthcoming voyage.</p>
                    <p>Soon, the sand beneath my feet started to crumble away, collapsing into the depths of the earth and swallowing me with it. As I tumbled down into the unknown, I was struck by the sudden image that I was just another grain of sand in a giant hourglass, marking another passing moment.</p>
                    <p>I landed in a cavern of sorts, though it was pitch black and difficult to see much of anything. The darkness was so complete it felt alive. I felt the weight of the earth all around me, aboive me, below me, consuming me and collecting me. I could hear your heart and mine thumping, the rush of blood in our ears like waves crashing on a beach.</p>

                        I turned my face upwards, to where I had fallen from, but to my surprise I saw a thousand thousand thousand holes across the sky, just like the one I had fallen from. I saw constellations, the lines of connection between us and the vast empty spaces that divide us. They were not holes but <em>stars,</em> and I was moving among them, another infinitesimal dot in the heavens, part of everything and yet miles apart and drifting alone through space and time. I thought of how we used to tell him, our Sweet Child, that stars were nothing but holes to heaven. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;">And I began to listen.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 30%">The cave rustled with the susurrus of voices. Hundreds of them, just too quite or distant to decipher but still flowing with the same beautiful cadence of human spech. I heard snippets of music too, thunderous applaus, the canned roar of a laugh track. Or at least I thought I could hear these things - it was like making shapes from static, seeing faces in the clouds.</p>

                <p>From the hush of voices, one grew louder, distinct, its edges clearly defined amongst the roar of the masses.</p>
                <p>I recognized it at once as yours, as our Sweet Jeremiah's.</p>
