                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Dosage: two roots, cut from plant outside camper</em>
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Exercised extraordinary caution with this one. I have been feeling fragile of late, and the visions promised by this plant are vivid and unforgiving. I must confess to a degree of nervousness, so I carried some of our journals with me into the desert and traced your handwriting with my finger, feeling you pulsing through the ink.</p>
                    <p>Without warning, I was assaulted with the plant's power. The desert beneath my feet began to undulate, like it too was breathing. I climbed onto one of the satellite dishes in hopes that I could hide there, but when I touched it, I felt it too was warm and soft. I could feel a heartbeat in its metal legs.</p>
                    <p>I felt the hot breath of the Wolves upon my neck and the backs of my knees. They were circling closer, closer, just like they were That Night. My head was throbbing and my vision blurring and I looked down to see the shotgun resting against my shoulder like an extension of myself and then I looked up to see you in front of me. I screamed and closed my eyes, and when I opened them again, the shotgun had transformed into our Sweet Jeremiah, a squalling babe in my arms.</p>

                    <p>After Jeremiah died, we threw ourselves into our mission. We investigated every possible opportunity for contact with our Beloved Boy - everything from Electronic Voice Phenomena to apparent wrinkles in space-time. We made maps and charted the stars and kept delated, meticulous notes in reams of paper we kept stacked in our garage. We became so invested in our work, I believe, it consumed us until there was nothing left of ourselves.</p>

                    <p>The words and letters acted as camouflage and helped me hide from the Wolves for awhile, but eventually it became clear that the act of study alone was not enough to bring our Boy back. We had to explore those distant mysterious realms and search for him ourselves, and we could not do it together. When you, My Love, told me of your plan, I realized just how much you had come to resemble the skeleton that already lives inside us - sunken eyes, bared teeth.</p>
