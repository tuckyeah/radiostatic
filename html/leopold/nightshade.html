                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Dosage: 6 seeds from plant found nearby. Washed down with Moonshine.</em>

                    <p>This trip now feels like it was a dream, and perhaps that is for the best. I remember the following visions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Saw my reflection in the metal of my canteen and almost died of fright - my face was a bloody mess. I panicked and tried to wash it off with sand, but the sand too turned to blood in my hands. I could see the muscles in my cheeks and forehead, the veins throbbing in time with my heartbeat, but as I watched, the vision faded before my eyes and I looked normal again.
                        </li>
                        <br />
                        <li>Our Sweet Jeremiah was there, though I could not see him - I could only feel him looking at me, as if I were a fish in his glass bowl. He never spoke to me directly, only observed me, but I felt the radiating glow of his approval like sun on my skin. He is so proud of my, My Love. He is proud of our Progress.</li>

                    <p>After I pulled the trigger, I collapsed on top of your body and there I wept for forty days and forty nights until it felt like the cells of my flesh were mingling with hers, my tears and her Vitreous Humours dancing now upon our cheeks. I remember looking into your Milky Eyes and seeing the Fear still in them, laid bare like a raw nerve.</p>

                    <p>Jeremiah came to me in a dream shortly thereafter. I will admit I was lost then, and moreover, I was losing my resolve, falling prey to Drink and Despair. But I heard him that night, clear as day. I heard his voice as it came crackling over my CB radio:</p>
