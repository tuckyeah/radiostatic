                <p>MY DEAR --</p>
                <br />
                <p>I write to you positively <em>brimming</em> with excitement and anticipation- after so many fruitless moons of searching, I truly finally believe I am close to finding the Nexus of Information and voices for which we have searched! My body is humming with possibility!</p>
                <p>It has been three days since I pulled off the highway and ended up here. I stumbled across this place entirely on accident - I was longing for a Cold Beverage and a Smoke to file the edges of my nerves and (Ask and you Shall Receive), I soon happened upon this makeshift Bar in an Airstream out in the middle of this wasteland.</p>
                <p>Little did I know, that was but the Tip of the Iceberg!</p>
                <p>Though there is no one else here at present, this ... <em>place</em> seems to be a waypoint of sorts for people just like us: lost and like-minded individuals who are driven on a quest to find the Truth and to let the Current of the Planets Course through our Lives!</p>
                <p>I have seen drawings of Constellations and Galaxies on the bathroom walls just like the sketches we used to make in our Journals and Reports together. I ran my fingers over the marker and thought for a moment maybe it would have been better if we drew them on walls instead of paper - our Message would have spread better, perhaps, been more permanent.</p>
                <p>Though it would have been harder to burn.</p>
                <p>I have been spending each day at the bar (though I PROMISE only to insinuate myself among the locals in order to document my findings for you) and the Bartender and his Young Friend have revealed themselves to be most hospitable. I told them I was a Man on a Mission and, with nary a clarifying question, they equipped me with my very own Fine Winnebago Camper not a hundred yards from where we stood. It is not much compared to their beautiful War-Era farmhouse (or, dare I say, our own?), but it is a place to rest my head and my Trusty Typewriter (from which I write to you now), so I am quite content.</p>

                <p>When I talk to you each night, reaching my voice out to you and our Sweet Jeremiah,</p>
                <p style="text-align: center"><em>(wherever you may be)</em>
                </p>
                <p>I can only hope that my intentions are strong and clear enough for you interpret, decode, and understand. If you could find it somewhere in your Infinite Compassion to reach out to such a wretch as me, it will surely give me Strength Anew! </p>
