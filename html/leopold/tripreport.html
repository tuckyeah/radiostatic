        <p>MY DEAR --</p>
        <p>Enclosed please find my latest Trip Journal and notes of my visions. As promised, I have continued our work, though I am afraid not with much success. I am doing my best to remain Intrepid in the face of this latest failure, but there are times when the night is very dark and full of terrors.</p>
        <p>I am becoming increasingly concerned that these Missives are not reaching you, though I have been following the instructions we set forth in our Research, so I am doing my best to still Believe and Trust that you are receiving them, wherever you may be. It is just that I miss you, My Dear, more than I thought possible. I keep reminding myself that you too are on a brave journey to a New Plane, an unkown land with its own challenges and hurdles, and that is likely why you have yet to respond to me. But still I long for your touch, your voice, to feel just one sign from you to know that you are still there and you can maybe forgive me for my faults and Weaknesses.</p>
        <p>It has been a Trial of its own to review the notes frmom our old Trip Journals, the ones we wrote together. I think of your hand beside mine, your furrowed brow, your determination and I am once again in Awe of you.</p>

            <br /> and I do not know what I am capable of.</p>
