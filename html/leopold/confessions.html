                <p>MY DEAR --</p>
                <p>When we began, we were so young and full of hope. Can you even recall those days? Thinking back on them now is like digging through the contents of some Stranger's attic; everything is covered with dust and the thick scent of decay.</p>
                <p>I miss you something Wicked on most days, but I know your Work is more important than my Foolish Heart. I am continuously in awe of you commitment to Our Cause. On my Weakest Days, I am ashamed to say I wish I could have joined you, but I know it is my duty to stay here, to Explore this Earth whilst you search the Great Beyond. Our Sweet Jeremiah is somewhere, My Dear, and I know we will find him soon.</p>

                <p>But I fear I am growing Weaker, and the Darkness is returning. I worry there is little I can do to control it - you know as well as I that I am helpess in its grasp. I am filled with self-hatred and loathing at my Weakness, and I can only trust you know that the Spirit is willing but the Mind may falter.</p>

                    <p>Forgive me, My Dear. I hope you can find it in your Wondrous Heart to continue to place your Trust in me.</p>
