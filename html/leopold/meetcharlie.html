                <p>MY DEAR--</p>

                <p>Enclosed please find the transcripts and journal of a Mr. Charles Waits, provided to me by Mr. Waits himself.</p>
                <p>Mr. Waits is another soul who seems to have found himself lost here, and we have a developed somewhat of a kinship over the past few weeks. I will not be so bold to call it anywhere near 'friendship,' as that word seems entirely antithetical to the very Aura of this arid and hostile environment, but we have certainly forged a connection and I have frequently found myself grateful for his company.</p>
                <p>Charlie first came to my Fine Winnebago one evening, asking to use my Trusty Typewriter to transcribe some entries from his journal. Skeptical at first, I inquired further. Though he is quite reticent, it seems he has been receiving radio communiques from a woman (known as "Junebug") since her disappearance some weeks ago. He told me has always been a huge radio fan; he used to work the nightshift in a tollbooth, and the late-night DJs were usually his only company. At first, her messages only told him to 'drive,' but once his car broke down here at our little outpost, the messages began to tell him to 'wait,' as befits his name. </p>
                <p>Charlie spends most of his days smoking cannabis and scanning the radio from the bed of his El Camino. Once he's received a message, he races to my Humble Camper and knocks thricely upon my door. I have recently told him about our Work and Quest, and he was most intrigued. He graciously offered to provide the enclosed findings to aid us in our Cause.</p>
                <p>I have so many questions! Who is talking to him? Is there an actual sentient being out there? Dare I speculate this is the Proof for which we have searched???</p>
                <p>Forgive me, I am getting ahead of myself again. Please review the enclosed and examine for anything I may have missed. As always, I eagerly await hearing your thoughts (or just hearing you.)</p>

                    <br/> Leopold
