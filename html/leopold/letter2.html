                <p>MY DEAR--</p>

                <p>I knew it! I knew this was the perfect place, that <s>my</s> OUR diligence would pay off! Yesterday eve, on my Daily Constitutional into the dunes, I came across it: a sea of satellites stretching as far as the eye can see, disappearing into the distant mountains! Oh, my love - you cannot imagine the immense energy there - I swear when I stopped and listened hard, I didn't hear just the rush of blood in my ears but thousands upon thousands of voices and sounds, echoing from some Great Beyond!</p>
                <p>I strained to catch the notes of your voice, or Sweet Jeremiah's, but I couldn't make anything out clearly. I hope you were not calling to me, and, if you were, you do not think me cruel and callous for ignoring you! I would never do such a thing - even thinking of your voices now is bringing tears to my eyes, so much so I have had to step away from my Trusty Typewriter and get a glass of water as I was unable to read my words through their blurry haze.</p>
                <p>Though I hope you do not think me weak because of this display of emotion. It is only that I am longing something fierce for your voice and your touch. There is just so much I wish I could tell you, so much for which I would apologize and yet, I find my words are failing me.</p>
                <p>But Your Intrepid Leopold will march onwards and find you soon, My Love! This discovery has filled me with life and excitement Anew. Soon we will all be together with our Sweet Jeremiah, I promise on my life (for whatever it may be worth).</p>
