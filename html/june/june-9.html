                                <p>I have spent so long wandering in this desert I am beginning to feel like Moses, though I am not sure my purpose is quite as clear. Since Charlie has been gone, I have found myself adrift. I can't even recall when I started walking.</p>
                                <p>My memories are a castle made of sand along the shore, and now the tide is coming in.</p>
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                <p>I headed to the Satellites, my last hope to find Charlie. There were still no footprints along the way, the sand completely undisturbed. I couldn't even find our own tracks from the other day (wasn't it just a day or so ago that we walked here together?)</p>
                                <p>Though even with nothing lead me, I found the field with no problems. I couldn't shake the sensation I was <em>pulled</em> here somehow, the way a compass needle must feel when it is pulled to the magentic pole.</p>

                                <p>The beasts stood silent, still; the dishes pointed at the stars like hundreds of searching sightless eyes. I stood watching them back until I saw a fluttering movement out of the corner of my eye.</p>

                                <p>Paper. Another page from the od man's journals. Perhaps he had come here after all.</p>
