                                <p>It seems as though the old man from the bar may be more trustworthy than my initial assessment. After a surprisingly resftful night's sleep, we headed to meet him.</p>

                                <p> He lives in a Winnebago a hundred yards back from the Bar. It's been out here so long it fades into the landscape.</p>
                                <p>Like a chameleon, its once-white paint is now the same light orange as the sand -- even the rust holes in the wheel wells look like the shadows in the dunes.</p>
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                <p>I am reminded of what the Bartender said, about how people come here to hide, just like desert fauna camouflage themselves in plain sight.</p>

                                <p>Fortunately, the old man is significantly more hospitable than his surroundings and he warmly welcomed us into his humble lodgings. He introduced himself as "[our] Intrepid Leopold." We sat at his Formica table and sipped watery powdered lemonade from plastic cups.</p>

<!--      TODO:                          does this link here work? I like it but...-->
                                <p>After what I deemed to be an appropriately polite amount of time, I asked. "So you mentioned that you too are <a href="../leopold/howl.html" style="font-weight: 800">looking for someone.</a> Can you tell us a little more about that?"</p>
                                <p>Leopold didn't say anything for a moment, just dragged the cup across the table, the rim leaving a wet glistened wave.</p>

                                <p>For another beat, we all stood transfixed at the cup's comet-tail arching across the table. </p>
                                <p>"Oh, I'm afraid I can't tell you that," he said, though not unkindly. "But I can show you something that might pique your interest."</p>

                                <p>"See how they sparkle?" Leopold said, and I noticed the tiny flashing bursts of light in the distance, which I had originally written off as a symptom of heat stroke. .</p>
                                <p>"Just like the stars." His whole face softened to expose a raw element of affection and adoration, which almost touched me.</p>
