                                <p>I genuinely almost expected it to fade into thin air as we approached, like a desert oasis from one of those old Loony Toons. </p>

                                <p> Charlie's smile was so bright it glowed brighter than the trailer. I saw a light in his eyes that I thought long since extinguished, and I have not seen him this giddy in ages.</p>
