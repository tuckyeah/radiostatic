                                <p>"Charlie, the man was insane. Quite literally. Between the drugs and his clear mental instability, we can't take anything he says seriously."</p>
                                <p>I looked up at him, but his mind was clearly elsewhere. He stared through the ground unblinkingly. At first, I thought he hadn't heard me, but slowly he nodded his head.</p>

                                <p>This wasn't like Charlie. He never gave up so easily. Something else was going on.</p>

                                <p>"So what are we doing here?" He asked, looking up at me blank and vulnerable. The space in my heart twinged with a strange desire to comfort him, though I did not move.</p>
                                <p>"What are you talking about? We're searching, Charlie."</p>

                                <p>"For <em>whom?</em>" He demanded with a violence in his voice I had never heard before.</p>
