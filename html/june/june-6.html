                                <p>I read and reread those pages until I was sure I had panned every last flake of gold from them.</p>
                                <p>"Charlie, the man was insane. Quite literally. Between the drugs and his clear mental instability, we can't take anything he says seriously."</p>

                            <td>
                                <p>I looked up at him, but his mind was clearly elsewhere. He stared through the ground unblinkingly. At first, I thought he hadn't heard me, but slowly he nodded his head.</p>
                                <p>"You're right."</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>This wasn't like Charlie. He never gave up so easily. Something else was going on.</p>
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                <p>"So what are we doing here?" He asked, looking up at me blank and vulnerable. The space in my heart twinged with a strange desire to comfort him, though I did not move.</p>
                                <p>"What are you talking about? We're searching for a missing person, Charlie--"</p>
                                <p>"For <em>who?"</em> He demanded with such a violence in his voice it almost frightened me. </p>

                                <p>He reached into his shirt pocket and dug out the worn piece of paper we had been carrying with us for how many miles, the missing persons poster with the black and white, Xerox bleached face.</p>
                                <p>"You can't even make out the face anymore, it's just shapes... like a Rorschach drawing, or something." </p>
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                <p>He was right, of course: there was nothing left of the face but the black smudges that hinted at the edges of features, a portrait in negative space.</p>
                                <p>"Who are we looking for, June? Can <em>you</em> remember?"</p>

                            </td>
                            <td>
                                <p>I studied it long and hard and came to the alarming realization that I could not remember the face either. How many times had I looked at this very poster? How many days had I traveled with it in my breast pocket, checking it just before I went to bed, showing it to potential leads and witnesses and now...</p>
                                <p>There was just an empty space where the memory should have been. </p>

                                <p>This realization frightened me more than I would like to admit, and certainly more than I would ever admit to Charlie.</p>
                                <p>"You're not making any sense, Charlie. Just take a deep breath and calm down. The heat makes people act crazy... and we've been on the road for so long--</p>
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                <p>"It's not that, June. None of this is real. I don't know what I'm doing, or where I'm going... I can't remember who I am, or who you are. I was wrong to think this was the right place - there is nothing here but rusted hunks of metal from a long forgotten war. That's all any of us is."</p>
                                <p>He stood then, and I was too stunned to do anything but watch him as he turned and headed back to his tent without another word.</p>
