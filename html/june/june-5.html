                                <p>Or at least, we found a note from him saying as much. It was pinned to Charlie's tent this morning, after he never showed up last night.</p>

                                <p>The note didn't list any specifics, but did come with a handful of roots Leopold said "may help us on our quest."</p>

                                <p>I quickly recognized it as <em>Atropa Belladonna.</em>

                                <p>In small doses, it was reputed to have some hallucinogenic properties, but at no small risk.</p>
                                <p> There was no easy or consistent way to determine the potency of any individual root.</p>

                                <p>After we found the note, I went to the Bar while Charlie checked the Winnebago for any clues about where the old man might have gone. Both of us returned to camp empty handed, or at least that's what I initially thought. </p>
                                <p>Charlie was acting particularly strange (even for him) after we returned. He sat with his hands clasped, staring at the ground as if he could see through to the center of the earth. </p>

                                <p>There was a haunted look to him that I found quite disconcerting, so I confronted him.</p>

                                <p>"You look like you've seen a ghost."</p>
                                <p>He turned his face up to me, seemingly suprised to see me there at all. He confessed he <em>had</em> found something at the camper, something he hadn't mentioned before.</p>
