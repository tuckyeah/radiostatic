                                <p>What was I to make of these letters? I could not explain them, and that gave me a sickly cold feeling in my chest.</p>
                                <p>That was my name, Charlie's name, and though they described someone similar to me, they were telling a story I had never heard before -- and certainly never experienced.</p>
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                <p>At first, I thought maybe these were new writings by the old man. Something he had jotted down recently, inspired by our meeting. </p>
                                <p> But the pages were sun faded and yellowed, much too old to have been written in the few days since Charlie and I had arrived at this place.</p>

                                <p>Hands trembling, I did the only thing I could and went back to the Bar. </p>

                                <p>"You've seen us before, my partner and I," I demanded. "Have we ever come in here before? Either separately or together?"</p>
                                <p>I wasn't sure what I was asking or looking for; I wasn't sure of anything anymore.</p>
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                <p>The Bartender stared at me evenly, as if considering me for the first time, sizing me up. "Nope, he said slowly, after allowing a long pause to pass. Though if I had, would that change anything?</p>
                                <p>Of course it would change things - it would change <em>everything.</em> But I couldn't explain how or why, I couldn't quite articulate what I meant and this surprised me.</p>

                            <td>
                                <p> A thousand half-thought ideas, phrases, raced through my head at the speed of light but I couldn't hold on to any of them. </p>
                                <p>They crumbled and disappeared as soon as my focus landed on them, leaving me standing there with my mouth open, poised to speak but with nothing to say. I pursed my lips.</p>

                                <p>"Maybe he's the one you're looking for," the Bartender said at last, with a surprising tenderness. "Or maybe he's looking for you. There's so many possibilities if you'll let yourself consider them..."</p>
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                <p>"But none of them are <em>real!</em> Or possible!" I exclaimed, feeling the world get lighter and brighter around me. </p>
                                <p>"How much does it really matter which one is 'right' or 'real'?" He said in that same even tone.</p>
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                <p>"Just because something is only in your head... does that make it any less real? Any less meaningful, important, valuable? What does it truly change?"</p>
                                <p>Before I could respond, I felt my knees give way beneath me as I collapsed to the floor.</p>
