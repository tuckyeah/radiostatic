                                <p>We set up camp a ways from the trailer/bar, but I could still see its glow on the horizon like a setting sun. Nearby, a generator hummed but otherwise the night was silent.</p>
                                <p> Distant mountains ringed what I had now determined were the shores of an ancient lake, putting us right in the middle of the basin.</p>
                                <p><em>This used to be ocean once,</em> I thought, <em>all of this.</em> </p>

                                <p>I slipped off my shoes and buried my feet in the sand. It was still warm from the day.
                                </p>
                                <p>"So you really think this is the place?" I asked.</p>
                                <p>It has to be. You heard what that old man said."</p>
                                <p>"Charlie, that old man would have told you the parking lot behind Denny's was 'the place' if you bought him another drink."</p>

                                <p>He turned to me and gave me an affectionate smile. "Let's just hear him out, see what he has to say. Can't you feel the energy here? We're onto something, June." He dug his hands into the sand. "The ground is actually <em>buzzing.</em>"</p>
                                <p>"Charlie. That's the generator powering the trailer."</p>

                                <p>"Of course. Every single thing on this planet is made from the interiors of collapsing stars; the elements that make up our molecules have been around since the dawn of space and time."</p>

                                <p>"I guess so, Charlie. If you think about it like that."</p>
