                    <p>My father served in the military as a naval captain, so it is only logical that, as his only daughter, I find comfort in discipline. I've grown to love the rigid structure, the safety of a system.</p>
                    <p>Charlie, on the other hand, chafes against authority. He prefers to be alone, to follow his own truths. And now that he has become my scaffolding, my skeleton, I will follow them with him.</p>

                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>I do not expect anyone else to understand why I follow Charlie, or why I trust in him so wholeheartedly. I can't say I believe everything he says, or even fully understand <em>what</em> it is exactly he believes.</p>
                    <p>But there is a genuine human compassion in him that I cannot seem to look away from. Being near him is like the white hot heat of the sun, and I fear I may have become dependent on it - and, by extension, on him - for my survial.</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>If there is one thing I have learned in following Charlie through these visions, it is not to put too much weight in feelings, or on the present moment.</p>
                    <p>A life is made out of a series of moments, and by putting so much weight on one over any other can dangerously tip the center of balance and alter our entire life's course.</p>
