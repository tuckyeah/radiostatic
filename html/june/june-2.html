                                <p> As my sight adjusted to the haze, I saw neon signs advertising cheap beer brands I've never heard of, dotting the faux wood-grain walls. The signage doesn't illuminate anything, but certainly lends a carnival sensibility to the place. I feel drunk just walking in. </p>

                                <p>Without looking up from the glass he was washing, the Bartender answered. "That's gonna be tough. Most people here are missing in some way or another. And most don't want to be found."</p>
                                <p>"So does that mean you won't be helping us?" I assumed.</p>

                                <p> A voice came from the only occupied stool in the place, in the shadows at the end of the bar. I hadn't seen the old man when we first came in, and his voice now startled me.</p>
