                            <p>I sat in my car until the sun went down and the stars came out, just staring at the horizon and trying to figure out what to do. I was out of ideas.</p>
                            <p>What else could I do? Call the police? Hah, what would <em>they</em> say? I didn't actually know her, not personally anyway. We've never spoken a word to one another, and I doubt she could pick me out of a crowd. Besides, I can't imagine they would understand how I came about all this information anyway. </p>

                            <p>And yet it seemed increasingly clear that I knew her better than anyone else on the planet, and even more likely that I was the only person who had noticed she was missing at all. No matter how much I tried to come up with an alternative, I couldn't ignore the obvious solution:</p>

                            <p>But this conclusion was terrifying to me in its own way. I'd never driven past that horizon - I'd never been further than a few hours east, I'd never even left the state. </p>

                            <p>I've always been small potatoes, nothing much of anything. My name is Charlie <em> Waits</em>, for goodnessâ€™ sake, and I've always lived up to my name The most traveling he had ever done was in my dreams, where I felt the most confident.</p>
