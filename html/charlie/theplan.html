                <p>The imaginary conversations I held with her as I watched her go about her day were satisfying, but I knew they would be nothing when compared to the real deal. June drove through my tollbooth that night for a reason, and I was not going to let her pass me by like I did with so many other opportunities in my life. I needed to come up with a plan for us to <em>meet.</em>

                <p>Over the next few months, I decided on the broad specifics: I would pick her up after work in my van and drive us up to my quiet, remote cabin way up north. There, we'd have a lot of time to talk. I could decorate the walls with pictures I've taken of her, including some of the ones I'd edited myself so she can see how great and natural we look together.</p>

                <p>I figured at first she'd be upset or angry, but once she gave me a chance, she'd see what I saw: we were soulmates, destined to be together. It was only a matter of matching reality to fate, and it was my responsibility to make that happen. For once in my life, the future seemed obvious and clear. I could trace my path in the stars like a constellation.</p>
