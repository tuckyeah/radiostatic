                <p>Well, I guess if we're being specific, it was more like a <em>series</em> of dreams, over the course of three (maybe four) months.</p>

                <p>I always dreamt (no pun intended) that I would meet someone just like her: someone smart and driven and so capable - everything I am not.</p>

                <p>I just didn't ever expect to actually <em>meet</em> her in dreams as well.</p>

                <p>At night, we did everything together - sometimes we were in love, but not always, and not always in the same way. She has been my wife, my sister. In one particualrly vivid dream, we were both cops working together as partners, not lovers. In other dreams, we were ghosts, haunting the planet together in search of some clue from our previous lives.</p>

            <div class="fadeIn">
                <p>No matter what we're doing, it's always the two of us and we're always searching for something. And I always wake up before we find it.</p>
