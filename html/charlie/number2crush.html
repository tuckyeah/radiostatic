                            <p>Well, I guess if we're being specific, it was more like a <em>series</em> of dreams, over the course of three (maybe four) months.</p>

                            <p>I always dreamt (no pun intended) that I would meet someone just like her: someone smart and driven and so capable - everything I am not.</p>

                            <p>At night, we did everything together - sometimes we were in love - but not always, and not always in the same way.</p>
                            <p> She has been my wife, my sister. In one particularly vivid dream, we were both cops working together as partners, not lovers. In other dreams, we were ghosts, haunting the planet together in search of some clue from our previous lives.</p>

                            <p>No matter what we're doing, it's always the two of us and we're always searching for something. And I always wake up before we find it.</p>

                            <p>I tried to resign myself to the fact that she was likely nothing more than a figment of my imagination, a personification of my loneliness, but I still could never shake the feeling that she <em>was</em> real and that she was out there, somewhere. Perhaps our respective subconscious minds had crossed into the other's dreamscapes through some miracle or mistake of physics.</p>

                            <p>Or something like that. I'm not very good at that kind of science stuff; that's June's area of expertise.</p>
