                        <p>As I stood there, I let my eyes drift across the shapes of constellations and I traced them with my tongue on the roof of my mouth - Orion, Cassiopeia, the Big Dipper.</p>

                        <p>Once, in a dream, she had chided me for being such a shut-in. "Don't you get <em>bored?"</em> she had demanded. She was right, of course, but now I hoped that maybe her disappearence was all aprt of an elaborate plan to get me out of my house and into the world. I knew it was a selfish notion, but hope springs eternal.</p>

                        <p>A meteorite sliced through Orion's Belt and flamed out spectacularly above me.
