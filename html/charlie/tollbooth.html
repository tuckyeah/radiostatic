                        <p>It was around three in the morning and I was working the graveyard shift like always. The booth window was open and a cool southern breeze carried the scent of blood and flesh from the meat processing plant a ways down the road. I had my radio turned up and I was listening carefully for the first notes of "Nights in White Satin."</p>

                        <p>I remember because Late Night Lionel from WTPX had given me a hot tip about a cash prize for the first caller after that song played. I'd gotten to be good friends with most of the local late-night DJs and they'd throw me a bone every now and then about some station contests - the odd Doors boxed-CD set or a station T-Shirt autographed by the members of the morning show.</p>

                    <div class="fadeIn">
                        <p> I never won any of the big ticket stuff - even this cash prize was a long shot - but it didn't bother me none. I was never meant to be a big ticket winner anyway.</p>

                        <p> My entire body broke out in goosebumps even though it was the middle of the summer, but not from fear - from excitement, anticipation. By the time the car slowed to pass through the gate, my heart was pounding so hard I could feel it in my finger tips. </p>

                        <p>She looked just like she did in my dreams: red hair, sensible pantsuit, wire-rim glasses, just a little bit of makeup to look like she was wearing none at all. She tossed her quarter in the basin and looked right at me.</p>

                        <p> That's when I realized I was gaping open-mouthed at her. Before I could gather myself and my manners, she gave me the warmest, most comforting smile I have ever received from another human being, and drove off into the night.</p>
