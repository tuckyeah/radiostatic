                            <p>I kept watch outside of June's apartment day and night, but after three days with no sign of her - and no sign of anyone looking - I began to worry. </p>

                            <p>I tried everything I could think of. I called her office, but they just told me to tell her she was fired if I saw her before they did.</p>
                            <p>She hadn't missed a day of work in almost five years, and that's what they said.</p>

                            <p>Finally, on the fifth day, I put on my old UPS uniform and snuck past the doorman into her building.</p>
                            <p>Standing outside her door while I jimmied the lock, I could <em>feel</em> that she wasn't there, but I went in anyway...</p>
