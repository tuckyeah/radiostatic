                        <p>I would have believed she'd climbed out of bed not moments before if her sheets hadn't been cool to the touch. Her comforter was thrown aside and the way her pale pink sheets blossomed open struck me as vulgar, obscene. June made her bed with military precision every morning upon waking. As soon as her feet hit the floor, she turned and began to re-crease the sheets.</p>

                        <p>Now they were exposed, thrown askew and I could feel the hot flames of shame creep up my face. I have never looked - never even <em>thought</em> about June nude, no matter how strong the temptation. I felt I had just invaded some part of her that I was never meant to see. </p>
