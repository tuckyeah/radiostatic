				<p>And yet, in the face of all this evidence, it seemed increasingly clear there I not only knew June better than anyone else, but that I was the only person on the planet who had noticed she had disappeared.</p>

				<p>When I first started dreaming of June, I felt the connection between us right away. She was smarter than me, much more quick witted and put together. She was the kind of person who just knew how to play this whole game we call Life, and I admired that immensely. But she never made me feel inferior - rather quite the opposite. I was always her partner, her equal. I was better at talking to people than she was, and I didn't take everything nearly as seriously. Rather than ever making me feel inadequate, our differences just made me feel better - we were two parts of the same giant machine, working perfectly together.</p>

				<p>I imagined telling her that I'd called the police to try to help, and I could already hear her laugh: harsh, though not cruel. "Every martyr needs a sword," she'd say and I'd have to agree with her, like I always did. She'd want me to find her on my own, knowing that maybe this was the learning experience I needed (or something like that). Maybe that's why she was gone in the first place.</p>

				<p>I've been driving now for five hours, aimless apart from steering west whenever possible. I'm heading for the desert, but I don't know what I will find there. </p>
