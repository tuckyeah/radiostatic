The satellites are rusting in their rest, and their silence hums something tangible. To wade out into their depths is to leave behind all sense of reality, for there was something out here - perhaps still <em>is</em> - and the energy remains palpable.</p>

                    <p class="fadeIn">This great basin was once part of a great sea, and these dishes are remnants of seashells. Put an ear up to them and listen: voices of people hidden in the static, voices long forgotten or never heard at all. TV jingles, radio ads, Nixon's resignation, a mother whispering goodnight in her child's ear. They're all crashing at once in this hushed ocean of sound.</p>
